## Usage

This project using node >= 16.14 & yarn 1.22.19

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danangekal/next-typescript-pwa-starter.git
yarn install
```

#### Development

```bash
yarn dev
```

#### Production

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

#### Docker Build

```bash
docker build -t next-typescript-pwa-starter .
```
